# Fitness tracker

One of my passions is getting is as best shape of my life. Fitness can be a complex concept, making it difficult to objectively evaluate an overall health and physical condition. I wanted a way to measure my overall fitness. In particular, a single metric to indicate my fitness level. It needs to be based on exercises that can be measured and not subjective. The key exercises I landed on were:
- bench press
- overhead press
- pull ups
- squat
- 5km run

These exercises cover the large majority of muscles in the body and cardiovascular system. In order to track the score I needed reference points to tell me what to target against. That's where I found these sources:
- Bench press: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/bench-press
- Overhead press: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/shoulder-press
- Pull ups: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/pull-ups
- Squat: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/squat
- Running: https://runninglevel.com/running-times/5k-times#google_vignette

My current aim is to get to intermediate stage for my age group. The calculation normalises the scores to give an overall score.

TODO I'd like to make this tool generic for others. Right now, the targets are tailored to my weight.
